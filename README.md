# stockApp


This is a trivial stock "management" application which serves three purposes:

1. demonstrate my programming ability to potential employers
2. allow me to familiarize with javaFx and modern Java-developement practices
3. finaly finish an old school project

### current state - work in progress - ***non functional***

The program logic is partially based on an old homework assignment but everything has been, or is in the process of being refactored. The program is in a sorry state because my time working on it has been quite short, and progress has been slow since this is my first time using javaFx (quite familiar with swing). I plan on further developing the project over the weekend.

I hope this is at least an approximation of proof that I have some grasp on the Java language. 

### practical information about running program

The code was developed in the Eclipse IDE and i haven't had the time to test how feasible it is to get running outside of that enviorment. _Works on my machine_, no other guarantees.

### Task list

  - [x] mock UI implemented in javaFx
  - [x] program layout - MVC pattern established (sort of)
  - [ ] query logic
  - [ ] query functionality
  - [ ] JSON-parsing
  - [ ] query caching

  - [ ] maven integration
  - [ ] cool shiny features
    - [ ] graphs
    - [ ] analysis
    - [ ] _actual_ portfolio management?
