# stockApp


This is a trivial stock "management" application which serves two purposes:

1. demonstrate my coding ability
2. allow me to familiarize with javaFx

### current state - work in progress - ***non functional***

The program logic is based on an old homework assignment but everything has been, or is in the process of being refactored. The program is in a sorry state because my time working on it has been quite short and thhis is my first time using javaFx.

It is I hope, however at least symbolic proof that I do know java.

### Task list

  - [x] mock UI implemented in javaFx
  - [ ] program layout
  - [ ] query logic
  - [ ] query functionality
  - [ ] JSON-parsing
  - [ ] query caching

  - [ ] maven integration
  - [ ] cool shiny features
    - [ ] graphs
    - [ ] analysis
